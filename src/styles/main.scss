/*
(central SCSS file to import all design tokens and global styles)

- allows for cleaner imports in component stylesheets
- instead of importing each file individually, just import this file once            
- e.g. @import "styles/main";
- imports design tokens
- imports global styles


- Think of @use as importing a SCSS file into another SCSS file.
- When you @use a file, all its variables, mixins, and functions are namespaced (so they donâ€™t pollute the global scope).
- You access them with the namespace prefix (alias).
